# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
## A Python Application for Understanding Sorting Algorithms
### Made using the TkInter GUI framework

#### DESCRIPTION
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a tool for understanding sorting algorithms.
Currently, the application supports the bubble and insertion sorting algorithms.
The application runs these algorithms on randomly generated lists of numbers and
shows a step-by-step visualization for how each algorithm works.


#### HOW-TO
To use the application, run the *sorting_visualizer.py* script. Once open, you 
have a few options to set before running the visualizer. First, the List Range
allows you to set the maximum value for each randomly gererated integer in the
array to be sorted. The List Size allows you to set how many integers to generate
in the array. Once these are set, you may click "Generate New List" to create
the number array. Once generated, you can select which sorting algorithm you
wish to see from the dropdown menu. Finally, you can select how fast you want
the visualization animation to play. To view the sorting animation, click "Sort".
